			<h2 class="subtitle">Our first blog post and a glimpse of our table at a "christmas" craft sale</h2>

			<p class="body-copy">A couple weeks ago, two friends and I split the cost of a table at a local craft sale here in Halifax. It was arranged very last minute, giving us only a week to plan and make items. A challenge! But we managed to pull it off, and successfully at that! Being some of the only Christmas venders at this particular event, we had lots of interest. </p>
			<p class="body-copy">You can see Alisha putting the finishing touches on the table as I snapped this shot. Her portion of the table was the far right - the gorgeous finger-knit scarves were her creation. In the middle  of the table were Mary’s wares. She was selling t-shirts and mugs filled with hot cocoa packs, and headbands which were also finger-kit. To the far left you can see the mini Christmas tree and tiny felt ornaments that I had for sale.</p>

			<p class="body-copy">I made a few hand-printed cards and gift tags as well, sort of a last minute thought. The mugs came from the Christmas before; I was given a set of Sharpie Oil Paint Pens and needed to test them out. I ended up creating a set called, "SweDish" because I was highly influenced from my trip to Scandinavia a couple summers ago.</p>

			<p class="body-copy">I think my favourite part of this whole thing was dreaming up the designs for the ornaments. Every time I started a new one, it was a clean slate - no two ornaments are exactly the same (except for the sets, I tried to keep those as similar as possible). I kept the colours simple and subdued, almost vintage with the mustard and cherry red. A few of the designs were taken from what I could remember from my great-grandmother’s ornaments. She used to have these round, white Christmas balls that were concave, boasting bright shimmery interiors. (#nostalgia)</p>

			<p class="body-copy">All in all, a blast and a fun experiment. We weren’t sure we would be able to come together in time, but we all managed it, and we even took on another craft sale two weeks later! You tend to learn a lot about your own creative process when you take on a crazy project like this, with such tight parameters - your juices get all churned up, and it’s wild what you can do when you put your mind (and your hands) to the task.</p>
