					<h1>Low Point Coffee Co.</h1>
					<h3>I’ve known these guys for ages, so it was a huge honour when they asked me to create a logo and brand for their cold brew coffee company.</h3>

					<!-- Logo & Labels– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – -->
					<h4>Logo & Labels</h4>
					<p class="subtitle">Bottle Labels</p>
					<p>We needed the logo to connect with their current customer base, but also to reach new consumers.</p><p>The concentrated and ready to drink products were put in a darker and lighter label respectively, as a visual cue.</p>
					<img src="img/bottles.jpg" alt="Coldbrew Bottles"/>

					<!-- Burundi Coffee Bean Bag Label– – – – – – – -->
					<p class="subtitle">Burundi Coffee Bean Label</p>
					<p>For this special run of coffee beans, I chose a bright, cherry red for behind the title to echo</p><p> the Burundi flag and the apple brandy barrels the beans were aged in.</p>
					<img src="img/beans.jpg" alt="Burundi Coffee Bean Bag Label"/>

					<!-- Sketches & Stamps– – – – – – – – – – – – – -->
					<p class="subtitle">Sketches</p>
					<p>Brainstorming sketches! I always start with pen and paper. The concept I was exploring was how</p><p>your highest point can be your lowest point, and your lowest point your highest.</p>
					<img src="img/sketch1.jpg" alt="Sketch 1"/>
					<img src="img/sketch2.jpg" alt="Sketch 2"/>

					<p class="subtitle">Hand Carved & Stamped Logo</p>
					<p>Carved out of soft rubber, stamped with white fabric paint. We opted for the cleaner version in the end,</p><p>but I still love this one. You can’t beat paint on paper.</p>

					<h1>King's College Orientation Week 2017</h1>

				<div id="Elaine and Willem" class="workItem">
				
					<h1>Elaine and Willem</h1>
					<p>Elaine is a good friend of mine. I was beyond excited when she asked me to design the invitations</p><p>for her special day. She wanted something wintry and simple, so the wreathe embellishment</p><p>was a natural choice. Classy and understated and really lovely.</p>
